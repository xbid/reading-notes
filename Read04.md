We need to know how to build web pages using HTML and CSS with no experience.

what JavaScript allows us to do ?
Making web pages more interactive by:

**1. ACCESS CONTENT**
By using Java Script to select any element or text  Like:

- Select the text inside all of the <hl> elements on a page.
- Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value.
- Find out what was entered into a text input
**2. MODIFY CONTENT**
Use Java Script to add or remove any content:
- Add a paragraph of text after the first <hl> element.
- Change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements.
- Change the size or position of an <img> element.

**3. PROGRAM RULES**
You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow , which allows it to access or change the content of a page. like:

- A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
- A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form
- An animation the viewport or as it called the viewport could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area.

**4. REACT TO EVENTS**
You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
Like it Could be run when:

- A button is pressed
- A link is clicked (or tapped) on
- A cursor hovers over an element
