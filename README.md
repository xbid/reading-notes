***What is the growth mindset?***

“In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.

A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

***TO SUCCEED, YOU MUST FIRST BEGIN***
_As Theodore Roosevelt Once Said:_
> "It is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed."
