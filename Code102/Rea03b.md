Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner.
It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
You must ask some questions like who would be interested in the subject of your site.

- What is the age range of your target audience?
- Which country do your visitors live in?
- What is the average income of visitors?
- How often do they use the web?
- What kind of device do they use to access the web?
- Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?

Invent some fictional visitors from your typical target audience. They can influence design decisions from color palettes to level of detail in descriptions.

### Why People visit your Website

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming.

While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason

Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users.

To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:

1. The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now

2. The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site

#### Specific

- Do they want general research?
- Do they need to be introduced to it?
- Are they looking for time sensitive information

#### Key Motivations

- If there is a specific goal, is it a personal or professional one
- Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a luxury?
- Are they looking for general entertainment or do they need to achieve a specific goal?
