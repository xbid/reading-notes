**LINKS**

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

***Writing Links***

Links are created using the ```<a>``` element. Users can click on anything between the opening ```<a>``` tag and the closing ```</a>``` tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

The text between the opening ```<a>``` tag and closing ```</a>``` tag is known as link text. Where possible, your link text should explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it (rather than just saying "click here"). Below you can see the link to IMDB that was created on the previous page.

**Linking to other sites**

```<a>```

Links are created using the ```<a>``` element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.

**EmaiL Links**

mailto:

To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the ```<a>``` element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.

**Opening Links in A new Window**

target

If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.
  
**Linking to A specific part oF the same page**

To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the <a>element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to.
  
**Linking to A specific part of Another page**

If you want to link to a specific part of a different page (whether on your own site or a different website) you can use a similar technique.

As long as the page you are linking to has id attributes that identify specific parts of the page, you can simply add the same syntax to the end of the link for that page.
