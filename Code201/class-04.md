**LINKS**

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

***Writing Links***

Links are created using the ```<a>``` element. Users can click on anything between the opening ```<a>``` tag and the closing ```</a>``` tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

The text between the opening ```<a>``` tag and closing ```</a>``` tag is known as link text. Where possible, your link text should explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it (rather than just saying "click here"). Below you can see the link to IMDB that was created on the previous page.
