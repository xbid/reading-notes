## What is Webpages.?

When you are looking at a website, it is most likely that your browser will be receiving HTML and CSS from the web server that hosts the site.

They also include extra content such as images, audio, video, or animations.

## How the web works.?

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

**How Pages use Structure**

The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website.

Now think about a very different type of document â€” an insurance form. Insurance forms often have headings for different sections, and each section contains a list of questions with areas for you to fill in details or checkboxes to tick. Again, the structure is very similar online.

**Structuring word documents**

The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information.

This might be expanded upon under subheadings lower down on the page

Each topic might have a new paragraph, and each section can have a heading to describe what it covers.

On below, you can see a simple document in Microsoft Word. The different styles for the document, such as different levels of heading, are shown in the drop down box.

On the previous page you saw how structure was added to a Word document to make it easier to understand. We use structure in the same way when writing web pages.

**HTML describes the Structure of pages**

You can see the HTML code for this page below.

<
    ``<html>
        <body>
            <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
            <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of  the page. And if the page is a long one it might  be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
            <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
            <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help  you follow the structure of what is being written.  There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level  headings).</p>
            <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
            <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
        </body>
    </html>``
