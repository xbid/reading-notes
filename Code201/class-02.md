# HEADINGS

```<h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6>```

Each one of these heading tags has its purpose.

- ```<h1>``` is used for main headings

- ```<h2>``` is used for subheadings

If there are further sections under the subheadings then the ```<h3>``` element is used, and so on...

*The Html Heading Tags*

~~~
<h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
<h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
<h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>
<h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
<h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>
~~~

**PARAGRAPHS**

```<p>```

To create a paragraph.

The browser will show each paragraph on new line, by default,

*The Html paragraph Tag*

~~~
<p>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magni, quos. Officiis, magnam!
</p>
<p>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magni, quos. Officiis, magnam!
</p>
~~~

*Result*

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magni, quos. Officiis, magnam!

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magni, quos. Officiis, magnam!

# BOLD and ITALIC


**Bold**

```<b>```

 By enclosing words in the tags ```<b>``` and ```</b>``` we can make characters appear bold.

*Italic*

```<i>```

By enclosing words in the tags ```<i>``` and ```</i>``` we can make characters appear italic.

# SUPERSCRIPT and SUBSCRIPT

**```<sup>```**

The ````<sup>``` element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.

**```<sub>```**

The ```<sub>``` element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.

# WHITE SPACE

When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.

# LINE BREAKS & HORIZONTAL RULES

**```<br />```**

if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag ```<br />```.

**```<hr />```**

To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the ```<hr />``` tag.

# STRONG and EMPHASIS

**```<strong>```**

The use of the ```<strong>``` element indicates that its content has strong importance. 

**```<em>```**

The ```<em>``` element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.
