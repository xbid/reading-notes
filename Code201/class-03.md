- **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

```<ol>```

The ordered list is created with the ```<ol>``` element.

```<li>```

Each item in the list is placed between an opening ```<li>``` tag and a closing ```</li>``` tag. (The listands for list item.)

- **Unordered lists** are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).

```<ul>```

The unordered list is created with the ```<ul>``` element.

```<li>```

Each item in the list is placed between an opening ```<li>``` tag and a closing ```</li>``` tag. (The listands for list item.)Browsers indent lists by default

- **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

```<dl>```

The definition list is created with the ```<dl>``` element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.

Inside the ```<dl>``` element you will usually see pairs of ```<dt>``` and ```<dd>``` elements.

```<dt>```

This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).

```<dd>```

This is used to contain the definition.

**Nested Lists**

You can put a second list inside an ```<li>``` element to create a sub-list or nested list.

**Summary** *Lists*

- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition. 

- Ordered lists use numbers.

- Unordered lists use bullets.

- Definition lists are used to define terminology.

- Lists can be nested inside one another.
