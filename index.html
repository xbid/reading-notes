            Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner.    
            It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
           <p>You must ask some questions like who would be interested in the subject of your site.</p> 
        
        <ul>
          <li>What is the age range of your target audience?</li>
          <li>Which country do your visitors live in?</li> 
          <li>What is the average income of visitors?</li>
          <li>How often do they use the web?</li> 
          <li>What kind of device do they use to access the web?</li> 
          <li>Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?</li> 
        </ul>

       <p>Invent some fictional visitors from your typical target audience. They can influence design decisions from color palettes to level of detail in descriptions.</p> 
           
       <table width="400">
           <tr>

    <h3>Why People visit your Website</h3>
       <p>Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming.</p>
        <p>While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason</p>
        <p>Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users.</p>
        <p> To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:</p>   
        <ol>
            <li>The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site</li>
            <li>The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Specific Goals</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Do they want general research?</li>
            <li>Do they need to be introduced to it?</li>
            <li>Are they looking for time sensitive information</li>

        </ul>
        <h5>Key Motivations</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>If there is a specific goal, is it a personal or professional one</li>
            <li>Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a luxury?</li>
            <li>Are they looking for general entertainment or do they need to achieve a specific goal?</li>
        </ul>
