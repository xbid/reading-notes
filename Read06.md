## UnderstandIng CSS: thinking Inside the Box

The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

### Block & Inline Elements

- Block level elements look like they start on a new line.

- Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line.

#### CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented

Using CSS, you could add a border around any of the boxes, specify its width and height, or add a background color. You could also control text inside a box â€” for example, its color, size, and the typeface used.
